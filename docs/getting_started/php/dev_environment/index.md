![Temporal PHP SDK](/img/sdk_banners/banner_php.png)

To follow the PHP SDK tutorials and build your own Temporal applications with PHP, you'll need the PHP SDK, the [RoadRunner application server](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner), and a Temporal development server.

## Install the PHP SDK

Install the PHP SDK using Composer:

```command
composer require temporal/sdk
```

## Download RoadRunner

See the [RoadRunner README file](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner) for installation instructions.


Next, you'll configure a local Temporal cluster for development.

## Set up a Temporal development cluster

import Cluster  from '@site/docs/getting_started/_temporal_cluster.md'

<Cluster />

Once you have everything installed, you're ready to build apps with Temporal on your local machine.
