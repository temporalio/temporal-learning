![Temporal Java SDK](/img/sdk_banners/banner_java.png)

Take your first steps into building apps with Temporal and Java by setting up your development environment, exploring how Temporal Applications work, and diving into the documentation.

## [Set up a local development environment for Temporal and Java](dev_environment/index.md)

**Estimated time**: ⏱️ ~5 minutes

Make sure you have everything you need to start working with Temporal on your local machine.

----

## [Run your first Temporal application with the Java SDK](first_program_in_java/index.md)

**Estimated time**: ⏱️ ~10 minutes

Download and run a small application and explore how Temporal executes Workflows and Activities, and how you can recover from failures.

## [Build a Temporal App from Scratch in Java](hello_world_in_java/index.md)

**Estimated time**: ⏱️ ~20 minutes

Write a program from the ground up with tests. 

----

## [Take Temporal 101 with Java](/courses/temporal_101/java.md)

**Estimated time**: ⏱️ 2 hours

In this course, you will explore the basic building blocks of Temporal: Workflows and Activities. You’ll use these building blocks along with Temporal's Java SDK to develop a small application that communicates with an external service. You'll see how Temporal helps you recover from failures and explore Temporal's execution model and event history. You'll use the Temporal Web UI and Temporal’s command-line tools to explore and interact with your Workflows, and you'll use what you've learned to add new features to your existing workflow.

----

## [Take Temporal 102 with Java](/courses/temporal_102/java.md)

**Estimated time**: ⏱️ 4 hours

In this course, you'll go beyond the basics of Temporal application development, acquiring skills that will help you on your journey to production deployment. Along the way, you'll encounter several common problems faced by Temporal developers, find out why they occur, and more importantly, how to identify and solve them, as well as how to avoid them in the future. By emphasizing key concepts and best practices, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how Temporal works and how to use it effectively.
