Take your first steps into building apps with Temporal by exploring how Temporal apps work.

## Set up your development environment

Make sure you have everything you need to start working with Temporal on your local machine.

* [Go](go/dev_environment/index.md)
* [Java](java/dev_environment/index.md)
* [TypeScript](typescript/dev_environment/index.md)

## Run your first program

Download and run a small application and explore how Temooral executes Workflows and Activities, and how you can recover from failures.

* [Go](go/first_program_in_go/index.md)
* [Java](java/first_program_in_java/index.md)
* TypeScript (coming soon!)

## Build a Temporal "Hello World!" app from scratch

Write a program from the ground up in one of the supported languages:

* [Go](go/hello_world_in_go/index.md)
* [Java](java/hello_world_in_java/index.md)
* [TypeScript](typescript/hello_world_in_typescript/index.md)
* [PHP](php/hello_world_in_php/index.md)
