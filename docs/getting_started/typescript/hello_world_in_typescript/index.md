### Introduction

Creating reliable applications is a difficult task. [Temporal](https://temporal.io) lets you create fault-tolerant, resilient applications using programming languages you already know, so you can build complex applications that execute reliably and recover from failures.

In this tutorial, you will build your first Temporal Application from scratch using the [Temporal TypeScript SDK](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-typescript). The app will consist of four pieces:

1. A [Workflow](https://docs.temporal.io/workflows): Workflows are functions that define the overall flow of the application.
2. An [Activity](https://docs.temporal.io/activities): Activities are functions called by Workflows, and they contain any logic that might fail or behave differently at different times. The Workflow you'll create executes a single Activity that takes a string as input and returns a formatted version of this string to the Workflow.
3. A [Worker](https://docs.temporal.io/workers): Workers host the Activity and Workflow code and executes the code piece by piece.
4. An initiator: To start a Workflow, you need to create a Client instance and call the `.start()` method. You'll write a separate script to do this.

When you're done, you'll have a basic application and a clear understanding of how to build out the components you'll need in future Temporal applications.

All of the code in this tutorial is available in the  [hello-world](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/hello-world) directory of the temporalio/samples-typescript repository. 

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial:

- [Set up a local development environment for developing Temporal applications using Node.js and TypeScript](/getting_started/typescript/dev_environment/index.md)

The TypeScript SDK requires Node.js 14 or later.

## Create a new project

:::info

This is a step by step guide that shows you how to create a project from scratch, and the goal is for you to better understand the structure of a Temporal application by creating the files on your own. 

This project exists in its entirety in the [Temporal TypeScript samples repo](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/tree/main/hello-world). To skip these manual steps and get the project running locally, use the [package initializer](https://docs.temporal.io/typescript/package-initializer#optional-flags) command `npx @temporalio/create@latest hello-world --sample hello-world`

:::

To build an app with the Temporal TypeScript SDK, you'll create a new directory and use `npm` to initialize it as a Node.js project. Then you'll add the Temporal SDK packages and other dependencies to your project. 

In a terminal, create a new project directory called `hello-world`:

```command
mkdir hello-world
```

Switch to the new directory:

```command
cd hello-world
```

Create the `package.json` file in the root of your project and add the following code to the file that defines the project, sets up scripts, and defines the dependencies this project requires:

[package.json](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/main/hello-world/package.json)

```json
{
  "name": "temporal-hello-world",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc --build",
    "build.watch": "tsc --build --watch",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "start": "ts-node src/worker.ts",
    "start.watch": "nodemon src/worker.ts",
    "workflow": "ts-node src/client.ts"
  },
  "nodemonConfig": {
    "execMap": {
      "ts": "ts-node"
    },
    "ext": "ts",
    "watch": [
      "src"
    ]
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@temporalio/activity": "^1.5.2",
    "@temporalio/client": "^1.5.2",
    "@temporalio/worker": "^1.5.2",
    "@temporalio/workflow": "^1.5.2",
    "nanoid": "3.x"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tsconfig/node16": "^1.0.0",
    "@types/node": "^16.11.43",
    "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^5.0.0",
    "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^5.0.0",
    "eslint": "^7.32.0",
    "eslint-config-prettier": "^8.3.0",
    "eslint-plugin-deprecation": "^1.2.1",
    "nodemon": "^2.0.12",
    "ts-node": "^10.8.1",
    "typescript": "^4.4.2"
  }
}
```

You should check out a few parts of the `package.json`, and the first is the `scripts` section. These are the `npm` commands you'll use to build, lint, and start your application code.  

Next, take a look at the packages listed as dependencies. These are the packages that compose the Temporal TypeScript SDK, and each package maps to the four parts of a Temporal application: an Activity, Client, Worker, and Workflow. There is also [Nanoid](https://npmjs.com/package/nanoid), an `npm` package which you'll use to generate a unique identifier for your Workflow. 

Finally, look through the `devDependencies` section. These are the packages that let you set up a Node.js project with [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) (a tool that automatically restarts your application when it detects a change in your code), TypeScript, ESLint, and ts-node.

Save the file, then download the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file with the command: 

```command
npm install
```

Downloading the dependencies can take a few minutes to complete. Once the download is done, you will have new a `package-lock.json` file and a `node_modules` directory. 

Your project workspace is configured, so you're ready to create your first Temporal Activity and Workflow. You'll start with the Workflow.

## Create a Workflow

Workflows are where you configure and organize the execution of Activities. You define a Workflow by writing a *Workflow Definition* using one of the Temporal SDKs. You can learn more in the [Develop Workflows](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/typescript/foundations/#develop-workflows) section of the Temporal documentation.

To begin your Workflow, create a new subdirectory called `src`:

```command
mkdir src
```

Create the file `workflows.ts` in the `src` directory. 

:::info

Below, there are two language tabs (TypeScript and JavaScript). TypeScript is selected by default, and you will add that code to your file. The JavaScript code is an example of the code that the TypeScript compiler will generate, and you do not need to copy and paste it. This is true for all the following code samples.

:::

Next, add the following TypeScript code to define the Workflow:

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-hello-workflow-->
[hello-world/src/workflows.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/hello-world/src/workflows.ts)
```ts
import { proxyActivities } from '@temporalio/workflow';
// Only import the activity types
import type * as activities from './activities';

const { greet } = proxyActivities<typeof activities>({
  startToCloseTimeout: '1 minute',
});

/** A workflow that simply calls an activity */
export async function example(name: string): Promise<string> {
  return await greet(name);
}
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

In this code, the variable `greet` is assigned the value of `proxyActivites`, which is a method from the Temporal TypeScript SDK that lets you configure the Activity with different options. In this example, you have specified that the Start-to-Close Timeout for your Activity will be one minute, meaning that your Activity has one minute to begin before it times out. Of all the Temporal timeout options,  `startToCloseTimeOut` is the one you should always set. 

The `example` function executes an Activity called `greet`, and the function returns the result of the Activity. You'll create the `greet` function in the next section. 

:::tip
No matter how many inputs you pass to a Workflow, it's a best practice to use an object. There are some JSON restrictions that you should be aware of, and you can learn more about the kinds of inputs you can pass to a Workflow in the [Workflow parameters](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/typescript/foundations#workflow-parameters) section of the Temporal documentation.

:::

Next, you'll define the Activity that your Workflow will execute. 

## Create an Activity


You use Activities in your Temporal Applications to execute non-deterministic code or perform operations that may fail.


For this tutorial, your Activity won't be complex; you'll create an Activity that takes a string as input and uses it to create a new string as output, which is then returned to the Workflow. This will let you see how Workflows and Activities work together without building something complicated.

With the Temporal TypeScript SDK, you define Activities similarly to how you define Workflows: using an exportable TypeScript module.

Your Activity Definition can accept input parameters. Review the [Activity parameters](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/typescript/foundations/#activity-parameters) section of the Temporal documentation for more details, as there are some limitations you'll want to be aware of when running more complex applications.

Create the file `activities.ts` in the `src` directory:

Add the following code to define a `greet` function:

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-hello-activity-->
[hello-world/src/activities.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/hello-world/src/activities.ts)
```ts
export async function greet(name: string): Promise<string> {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

You've completed the logic for the application; you have a Workflow and an Activity defined. Next, you'll write code to configure and launch a Worker.

## Configure and run a Worker

A [Worker](https://docs.temporal.io/concepts/what-is-a-worker) hosts Workflow and Activity functions and executes them one at a time. The Temporal Server tells the Worker to execute a specific function from information it pulls from the [Task Queue](https://docs.temporal.io/concepts/what-is-a-task-queue). After the Worker runs the code, it communicates the results back to the Temporal Server.

Create a file called `worker.ts` and add the following code to define the Worker: 

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-hello-worker-->
[hello-world/src/worker.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/hello-world/src/worker.ts)
```ts
import { Worker } from '@temporalio/worker';
import * as activities from './activities';

async function run() {
  // Step 1: Register Workflows and Activities with the Worker and connect to
  // the Temporal server.
  const worker = await Worker.create({
    workflowsPath: require.resolve('./workflows'),
    activities,
    taskQueue: 'hello-world',
  });
  // Worker connects to localhost by default and uses console.error for logging.
  // Customize the Worker by passing more options to create():
  // https://typescript.temporal.io/api/classes/worker.Worker
  // If you need to configure server connection parameters, see docs:
  // https://docs.temporal.io/typescript/security#encryption-in-transit-with-mtls

  // Step 2: Start accepting tasks on the `hello-world` queue
  await worker.run();
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

In the code, you create and call an async function named `run`. It creates and runs a Worker. It configures the Worker with a `workflowsPath` (the location of your workflow file), your Activity functions, and the name of the Task Queue. In this example, you name the Task Queue `hello-world`.

Now you will use an `npm` script to start your Worker using Nodemon, which will reload whenever it detects changes in your file, hence the command name `start.watch`. Run the command: 

```command
npm run start.watch
```
The script runs and produces output similar to the following:

```output
> temporal-hello-world@0.1.0 start
> ts-node src/worker.ts workflow.watch

```

In the output, you will see the Worker options and their values, the Webpack bundling output, and timestamps from Nodemon describing which programs have been invoked. 

Now that you have your Worker running, it's time for you to start a Workflow Execution. 

## Configure a Workflow Execution

You can start a Workflow Execution by using the Temporal CLI or by writing code using the Temporal SDK.

Starting a Workflow Execution using the Temporal SDK involves connecting to the Temporal Server, configuring the Task Queue the Workflow should use, and starting the Workflow with the input parameters it expects. In a real application, you may invoke this code when someone submits a form, presses a button, or visits a certain URL. In this tutorial, you will create a `client.ts` file that triggers your Temporal Workflow. 


Open a new tab in your terminal, create a `client.ts` file in the `src` directory, and add the following code to your file to create a client that will kick off your Workflow Execution:

<!--SNIPSTART typescript-hello-client-->
[hello-world/src/client.ts](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-typescript/blob/master/hello-world/src/client.ts)
```ts
import { Connection, Client } from '@temporalio/client';
import { example } from './workflows';
import { nanoid } from 'nanoid';

async function run() {
  // Connect to the default Server location (localhost:7233)
  const connection = await Connection.connect();
  // In production, pass options to configure TLS and other settings:
  // {
  //   address: 'foo.bar.tmprl.cloud',
  //   tls: {}
  // }

  const client = new Client({
    connection,
    // namespace: 'foo.bar', // connects to 'default' namespace if not specified
  });

  const handle = await client.workflow.start(example, {
    // type inference works! args: [name: string]
    args: ['Temporal'],
    taskQueue: 'hello-world',
    // in practice, use a meaningful business ID, like customerId or transactionId
    workflowId: 'workflow-' + nanoid(),
  });
  console.log(`Started workflow ${handle.workflowId}`);

  // optional: wait for client result
  console.log(await handle.result()); // Hello, Temporal!
}

run().catch((err) => {
  console.error(err);
  process.exit(1);
});
```
<!--SNIPEND-->

In the `client.ts` file, the `run` function sets up a connection to your Temporal Server, invokes your Workflow, passes in an argument for the `name` parameter (in this example, the name is Temporal) and assigns the Workflow a unique identifier with Nanoid. The client dispatches the Workflow on the same `hello-world` Task Queue that the Worker is polling on.

:::tip Specify a Workflow Id
A Workflow Id is unique in a namespace and is used for deduplication. Using an identifier that reflects some business process or entity is a good practice. For example, you might use a customer identifier as part of the Workflow Id if you run one Workflow per customer. This would make it easier to find all of the Workflow Executions related to that customer later.
:::

:::tip Get your results now or later

You can [get the results](https://docs.temporal.io/dev-guide/typescript/foundations/#get-workflow-results) from your Workflow right away, or you can get the results at a later time. This implementation attempts to get the results immediately by logging the output of the `example` Workflow which in turn calls the `greet` Activity. 
::: 

Now that your client code is written, it's time for you to use this code to start your Workflow Execution. 

## Start a Workflow Execution

To start your Workflow, open a new tab in your terminal and  run the `npm` script: 

```command
npm run workflow
```

The script runs and prints the result:  

```
Hello, Temporal! 
```

The "Hello, Temporal!" output is generated as the result of a few steps. First, `client.ts` passes `Temporal` as an argument to the Workflow. Next, the Workflow passes the argument to the Activity, and finally the Activity returns `Hello, ${name}!`.


You have successfully built a Temporal application from scratch!

## Conclusion

You now know how to build a basic Temporal application using the TypeScript SDK.
