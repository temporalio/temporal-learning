---

To follow the TypeScript SDK tutorials and build your own Temporal applications, you'll need the TypeScript SDK and a Temporal server.

## Install Node.js

The TypeScript SDK requires Node.js 14 or later.

Install Node.js via your package manager by following [the official Node.js instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).

## Set up the Temporal TypeScript SDK


You can create a new project with the Temporal SDK:.

```command
npx @temporalio/create@latest ./my-app
```

You can also add the Temporal TypeScript SDK to an existing project with the following command:

```command
npm install @temporalio/client @temporalio/worker @temporalio/workflow @temporalio/activity
```


## Set up a Temporal development cluster

Download and install the Temporal development cluster locally using Docker Compose. You'll run this server in the background while you develop your applications.

You must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) installed.

Then clone the [temporalio/docker-compose](https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose) repository and run `docker-compose up` from the root of that repo:

```command
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/docker-compose.git
```

```command
cd docker-compose
```

```command
docker-compose up
```

When the Temporal Cluster is running, the Temporal Web UI becomes available in your browser: [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/)

Review other methods in the [Run a dev Cluster](https://docs.temporal.io/application-development/foundations#run-a-dev-cluster) section in Temporal's documentation.

Once you have everything installed, you're ready to build apps with Temporal on your local machine.
