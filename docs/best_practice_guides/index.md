## Purpose

This section outlines foundational principles and best practices for using Temporal Cloud. It exists to provide a **validated, opinionated** framework that helps teams that either do not have an enablement plan for or want to evaluate and refine their use of Temporal. 

## Why did we create this?

Without clearly defined Temporal standards, organizations often struggle with inconsistent workflow implementations, fragmented best practices, and misaligned development approaches. This documentation framework helps developers establish robust Temporal standards by providing:

- **Proven foundation principles** that have been validated across diverse use cases
- **Standardized implementation patterns** for teams to adopt consistently across projects
- **Confidence in alignment** with Temporal's architectural principles and recommended practices

By following this guidance, developers can define comprehensive Temporal standards that ensure their workflow orchestration implementations are maintainable, scalable, and aligned with platform best practices from the start.

## Who is this for?

This section is intended for:

- Developers responsible for building a Temporal Cloud practice within their organization.
- Anyone building tutorials, courses, onboarding paths, or documentation
- Partners or vendors creating Temporal-related learning materials

## How to start using this? 

- **Starting from scratch?** Follow this guidance as your default.
- **Already have a plan?** Use this to challenge assumptions and improve structure.
- **Need to justify your approach?** Point to this document as Temporalâ€™s baseline strategy.
