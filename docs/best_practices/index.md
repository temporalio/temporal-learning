# Best Practices Guide

## Purpose

This section outlines the foundational principles and standards for creating customer-facing learning experiences using Temporal. It exists to provide a **validated, opinionated framework**—especially valuable if you do not have an enablement plan in place. If you do have a plan, use this guidance to evaluate and refine it.

This is not a collection of optional tips. It is structured guidance that reflects what has worked for customers and what enables successful self-serve education.

## Why This Exists

Without a clear strategy, learning content often becomes fragmented, inconsistent, or misaligned with user needs. This guidance prevents that by offering:
- A starting point that’s been tested and validated
- A common structure for teams working on enablement
- Confidence that what you’re building aligns with Temporal’s standards

## What This Is
This is a **prescriptive set of best practices** for building and maintaining learning resources at Temporal. Use it to drive decisions, justify approaches, and ensure alignment across teams and contributors.

## Who This Is For
This section is intended for:
- Anyone building tutorials, courses, onboarding paths, or documentation for customers
- Internal teams responsible for product education and enablement
- Partners or vendors creating Temporal-related learning materials

## How to Use This
- **Starting from scratch?** Follow this guidance as your default.
- **Already have a plan?** Use this to challenge assumptions and improve structure.
- **Need to justify your approach?** Point to this document as Temporal’s baseline strategy.
