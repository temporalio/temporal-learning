# Best Practices Guides

## Purpose

This section outlines foundational principles and best practices for using Temporal Cloud. It exists to provide a **validated, opinionated** framework that helps teams that either do not have an enablement plan for or want to evaluate and refine their use of Temporal. 

## Why did we create this?

Without a clear strategy, learning content often becomes fragmented, inconsistent, or misaligned with user needs. This guidance prevents that by offering:
- A starting point that’s been tested and validated
- A common structure for teams working on enablement
- Confidence that what you’re building aligns with Temporal’s standards

## Who is this for?

This section is intended for:
- Anyone building tutorials, courses, onboarding paths, or documentation for customers
- Internal teams responsible for product education and enablement
- Partners or vendors creating Temporal-related learning materials

## How to start using this? 

- **Starting from scratch?** Follow this guidance as your default.
- **Already have a plan?** Use this to challenge assumptions and improve structure.
- **Need to justify your approach?** Point to this document as Temporal’s baseline strategy.
