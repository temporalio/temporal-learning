When you are building a TypeScript application, you will typically build it locally, testing its functionality first, then deploy it to a public cloud provider for production use.

In this two-part tutorial, you will first build a Work Queue Slack App with TypeScript and Temporal locally on your machine using the Temporal CLI.
Then, you will deploy it to production on a DigitalOcean Droplet using Temporal Cloud.
