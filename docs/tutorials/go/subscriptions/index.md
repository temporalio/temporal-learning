### Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll build an email subscription web application using Temporal and Go. You'll create a web server to handle requests, and use Temporal Workflows, Activities, and Queries to build the core of the application. Your web server will handle requests from the end user and interact with a Temporal Workflow to manage the email subscription process. Since you're building the business logic with Temporal's Workflows and Activities, you'll be able to use Temporal to manage each subscription rather than relying on a separate database or queue. This reduces the complexity of the code you have to write and support.

You'll create an endpoint for users to give their email address, and then create a new Workflow Execution using that email address which will simulate sending an email message at certain intervals. The user can check on the status of their subscription, which you'll handle using a Query, and they can end the subscription at any time by unsubscribing, which you'll handle by cancelling the Workflow Execution. You can view the user's entire process through Temporal's Web UI. For this tutorial, you'll simulate sending emails, but you can adapt this example to call a live email service in the future.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a clear understanding of how to use Temporal to create and manage long-running Workflows within a web application.

You'll find the code for this tutorial on GitHub in the [email-subscription-project-go](https://github.com/temporalio/email-subscription-project-go) repository.

## Prerequisites 

- [Set up a local development environment for Temporal and Go](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/go/dev_environment/).
- Complete the [Hello World](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/go/hello_world_in_go/) to ensure you understand the basics of creating Workflows and Activities with Temporal.
- Create a new directory for the project called `email-subscription-project`.
- Run `go mod init subscribeemail` to create a Go module file in the project directory.
- Run `go mod tidy` to update the Go module file.

:::note

Always run `go mod tidy` after importing new packages to the application.

## Develop the Workflow

A Workflow defines a sequence of steps defined by writing code, known as a [Workflow Definition](https://docs.temporal.io/workflows#workflow-definition), and are carried out by running that code, which results in a Workflow Execution.

The Temporal Go SDK recommends the use of a single struct for parameters and return types. This lets you change fields without breaking Workflow compatibility.
Before writing the Workflow Definition, you'll define the data object used by the Workflow Definition.

To set up the struct, create a new file called `subscribe.go` in your project directory. This file will hold some constants you'll use in the application.

This struct will represent the data you'll send to your Activity and Workflow.
You'll create an `EmailDetails` struct with the following fields:
 - `EmailAddress`: a string to pass a user's email
 - `Message`: a string to pass a message to the user
 - `IsSubscribed`: a boolean to track whether the user is subscribed
 - `SubscriptionCount`: an integer to track the number of emails sent

Add the following code to the `subscribe.go` file to define the struct, as well as the Task Queue name and the host and port your web API will use:

<!--SNIPSTART subscription-workflow-go-subscribe {"selectedLines": ["1-11"]}-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

Now that you have your `EmailDetails` struct defined, you can move on to writing the Workflow Definition.

To create a new Workflow Definition, create a new file called `workflow.go`. This file will contain the `SubscriptionWorkflow()` function.

Use the `workflow.go` file to write deterministic logic inside your Workflow Definition and to execute the Activity.

Add the following code to define the Workflow:

<!--SNIPSTART subscription-workflow-go-main {"selectedLines": ["1-15", "24-29", "53-92"]}-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

The `SubscriptionWorkflow()` function requires two arguments: `ctx` and `EmailDetails`.  `ctx` references `workflow.Context`, which the Go SDK uses to pass around Workflow Execution context.
`EmailDetails` propagates the function's `data` struct. which will be used to execute the Activity.

The `SubscriptionWorkflow()` function uses a `for` loop to send the emails. The `for` loop executes the `SendEmail` Activity while `IsSubscribed` is `true`, and uses a Timer to pause the Workflow between emails.  The Timer can pause the Workflow for seconds, days, months, or even years, depending on your business logic.

Later in this tutorial, you will find that the user's email address is set to the [Workflow Id](https://docs.temporal.io/workflows#workflow-id). This means that attempting to subscribe with the same email address twice will result in an error and prevent the Workflow Execution from spawning again.

Therefore, only one running Workflow Execution per email address can exist within the associated [Namespace](https://docs.temporal.io/namespaces). 
This ensures that the user won't receive multiple email subscriptions. This also helps reduce the complexity of the code you have to write and maintain.

With this Workflow Definition in place, you can now develop an Activity to send emails.

## Develop the Activities

An [Activity](https://docs.temporal.io/activities) is a normal function or method that executes a single, well-defined action (either short or long running), such as calling another service, transcoding a media file, or sending an email message. Workflow code orchestrates the execution of Activities, persisting the results.

Create a new file called `activities.go` and add the following code to create the Activity Definition:

<!--SNIPSTART subscription-workflow-go-activities-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

Each iteration of the Workflow loop will execute this Activity, which simulates sending a message to the user.

Now that the Activity Definition and Workflow Definition have been created, it's time to write the Worker process.

## Build the Worker

Temporal Workflows and Activities are executed by [Workers](https://docs.temporal.io/workers) that listen on specific Task Queues. When Workflows and Activities return, the Workers send the results back to the Temporal Cluster.

Create a `worker` folder, and create the `main.go` file for the [Worker program](https://docs.temporal.io/workers#worker-program).

<!--SNIPSTART subscription-workflow-go-worker-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

Now that you've written the logic to execute the Workflow and Activity Definitions, try to build the gateway.

## Build the web server

The web server is used to handle requests.
This tutorial uses [Go's HTTP library](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) as the entry point for initiating Workflow Executions and for communicating with the `/subscribe`, `/unsubscribe`, and `/details` endpoints. 

Create a `gateway` folder with the file `main.go`.
Establish your JSON request and response structs, set the endpoint handlers, and connect to the Temporal Client.

<!--SNIPSTART subscription-workflow-go-gateway {"selectedLines": ["1-25", "197-215"]}-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

The Temporal Client enables you to communicate with the Temporal Cluster. Communication with a Temporal Cluster includes, but isn't limited to, the following:

- Starting Workflow Executions
- Querying Workflow Executions
- Getting the results of a Workflow Execution

The `RequestData` and `ResponseData` structs format information in JSON format.
Temporal recommends JSON formatting for data that's handled by other programsâ€”a good practice to establish for a future of live service interactions.

Now that the connection to the Temporal Server is open, define your first endpoint.

Create a `subscribeHandler()` function in the same file so users can subscribe to the emails.

<!--SNIPSTART subscription-workflow-go-gateway {"selectedLines": ["26-96"]}-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

Use error handlers to ensure that the function only responds to a "POST" request in JSON format.
After decoding the request, use `workflowOptions` to pass in the user's email address and set the Workflow Id.
This ensures that the email is unique across all Workflows so that the user can't sign up multiple times.
They'll only receive the emails they've subscribed to, and once they unsubscribe, they cancel the Workflow run.

With this endpoint in place, you can now send a "POST" request to `/subscribe` with an email address in the request body. 
In return, you'll receive a JSON response that shows a new Workflow has started, along with a welcome email.

But how would you get details about the subscription? 
In the next section, you'll query your Workflow to get back information on the state of things.

## Add a Query

You can let users get information about their subscription details by using a Query.

To allow users to retrieve information about their subscription details, add a new Query handler to the `SendEmailWorkflow` Workflow.

Open the `workflow.go` file and add a Query handler to the top of the Workflow Definition, right after the logging statement::

<!--SNIPSTART subscription-workflow-go-main {"selectedLines": ["15-24"]}-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

This Query handler returns the contents of the `emailDetails` variable. Queries should never mutate anything in the Workflow.

You can use Queries even if the Workflow completes, which is useful for when the user unsubscribes but still wants to retrieve information about their subscription.

Now that you've added the ability to Query your Workflow, add the ability to Query from the web API. 

Create a function called `showDetailsHandler()` in which a user can get information about their subscription details.
Make sure to include error handlers to ensure proper "GET" requests and responses.

<!--SNIPSTART subscription-workflow-go-gateway {"selectedLines": ["153-195"]}-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

The resulting function returns the email address associated with the Workflowâ€”in other words, the Workflow Id.

Now that users can subscribe and view the details of their subscription, you need to provide them with a way to unsubscribe.

## Unsubscribe users with a Workflow Cancellation request

Users will need to unsubscribe from the email list at some point. To gracefully handle the Unsubscribe request, the Workflow Definition needs a cancellation handler.

Create a new `defer` block within `SubscriptionWorkflow()` to send cancellation emails and end the Workflow Execution:

<!--SNIPSTART subscription-workflow-go-main {"selectedLines": ["31-52"]}-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

To send a cancellation notice to an endpoint, use the HTTP `DELETE` method on the `unsubscribe` endpoint to return a [cancel()](https://python.temporal.io/temporalio.client.WorkflowHandle.html#cancel) method on the Workflow's handle.

Create a new function called `unsubscribeHandler()` that sends a cancellation request to the Workflow Execution.

<!--SNIPSTART subscription-workflow-go-gateway {"selectedLines": ["97-152"]}-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

The `CancelWorkflow()` function sends a cancellation request to the Workflow Execution you started on the `/subscribe` endpoint. 

When the Workflow receives the cancellation request, it will cancel the Workflow Execution and return a `CancelledError` to the Workflow Execution.
This is then handled by the error handlers included in the `unsubscribeHandler()` function.

Users can now send a "DELETE" request to `/unsubscribe` to cancel the Workflow associated with the request body's email address. 
This lets users unsubscribe from the email list and prevent any further emails from sending.

Now that you've added the ability to unsubscribe from the email list, test your application code to ensure it works as expected.

## Create integration tests

Integration testing is an essential part of software development that helps ensure that different components of an application work together correctly.
In this section, you'll write an integration test using the Go SDK to test the cancellation of a Workflow.

The Temporal Go SDK includes functions to help test your Workflow Executions.
Use these functions alongside the [Testify module](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) to create integration tests against a test server or a given Client.

To set up the test environment, create a new file called `subscription_test.go`.
Create a test function called `Test_CanceledSubscriptionWorkflow()`.

<!--SNIPSTART subscription-workflow-go-subscribe-test-->
<!--SNIPEND-->

This function creates a Workflow Execution by starting the Workflow with some test data.
The function then cancels it with the `CancelWorkflow()` function that was assigned to `RegisterDelayedCallback()`.

With the test function created, run it to see if it works.
Use the command `go test` to start the test.

```

```

With a cancellation request that fires after five seconds, this test shows the successful creation of a subscription as well as its cancellation.
You've successfully written, executed, and passed a Cancellation Workflow test. 

Temporal's Go SDK provides a number of functions that help you test your Workflow Executions. 
By following the best practices for testing your code, you can be confident that your Workflows are reliable and performant.

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how to build an email subscription application using Temporal and Go.
By leveraging Workflows, Activities, and Queries, the tutorial shows how to create a web server that interacts with Temporal to manage the subscription process.

With this knowledge, you'll be able to use more complex Workflows and Activities to create even stronger applications.
