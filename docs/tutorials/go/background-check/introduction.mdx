Welcome to the Temporal Go SDK Background Check tutorial.

## Why Temporal?

**Why should you use Temporal to build applications?**

If you are reading this, chances are you already have some notion of why you want to use Temporal.
However, if you are still unsure, there are three major reasons why Temporal might be right for you.

1. **Reliabile execution.**
   With Temporal, you can rely on your application to work.
   The design of the system ensures that, once started, an application's main function executes to completion, whether that takes minutes, hours, days, weeks, or even years.
   Temporal calls this "Durable Execution".

2. **Code structure.**
   Temporal's programming model offers developers a way to express their business logic into coherent "Workflows" that are much easier to develop than distributed code bases.

3. **State visibility.**
   The Temporal system provides out-of-the-box tooling that enables developers to see the state of their applications whenever they need to.

## Audience

**Who is this tutorial for?**

This tutorial is for any developer who wants to learn how to develop Temporal Applications.
This tutorial assumes that you have some experience with the Go programming language.
And it assumes that you, the developer, are ready to build an application to learn Temporal.

However, with that said, Temporal enables developers to build a wide range of applications that serve a variety of use cases. Thus, we recommend that developers are equipped with some of the following Go programming skills and experiences to develop production-level Temporal Applications and to generally succeed with the Temporal Go SDK.**

:::tip Recommended

**Core fundamentals:**

- Go syntax and structure
- Variables, Types, and Structures
- Control flow: loops, conditionals
- Slices and Maps
- Basic I/O operations

**Go-specific principles:**

- Understanding Goroutines and Channels
- Error handling in Go
- Go Modules and Dependency Management
- Pointers in Go
- Structs, Interfaces, and Embedding
- Go Testing and Benchmarking

:::

:::info Nice to have

**Tools**

We recommend that developers have a beginner to moderate level of experience using a Go IDE, or a preferred editor with Go extensions, such as Visual Studio Code with Go extension.

**Testing**

We recommend that developers have some experience with Go's built-in testing framework.

**Code base version control**

We recommend that developers have some experience using a version control system, such as Git.

**Dependency management**

Being familiar with Go modules for dependency management can be beneficial.

**Listing and sorting**

Understanding SQL-like syntax and CRUD operational concepts can help utilize Temporalâ€™s Visibility tools.

**Security**

We recommend having some understanding and experience with TLS, security certificates, and private keys for onboarding with Temporal Cloud or setting up a Self-Hosted Cluster.

**Privacy**

We advise having an understanding and experience with PII and sensitive information encryption for applications that handle user data.

:::

:::caution Complex and large-scale use cases

**Large scale use cases**

For intricate and vast use cases, having some experience with the following could be helpful:

- Deeper Go runtime understanding, including:
  - Go's memory model
  - Go garbage collection
- Design Patterns applicable to Go, such as Singletons or Factories.
- Distributed system architectures:
  - Event-driven architectures and how events drive processes in the context of Workflows.
- The distinctions between stateful vs. stateless processes.
- Implications of service scalability on performance and reliability.
- Ensuring fault tolerance and understanding supervisor systems for progress checks and resumptions.

## Competencies

**What does this tutorial cover?**

This tutorial contextualizes the concepts, features, and tools that developers encounter on their journey through Temporal Application development.

It provides focused learning through a specific use-case and relies on a set of sample applications specifically tailored to meet the needs of each chapter.
Each application is meant to capture the iterative steps, showcasing best practices, and teach core concepts.

Essentially, you will iterate on the application in each chapter, learning new things as you go.

**What will you learn while you build the application?**

By building the application, you will attempt to adopt the following competencies, where each competency is supported by a set of learning objectives:

- **Construct a new Temporal Application project.**
  - **Describe the tools available and recommended to develop Workflows.**
  - **Describe the code that actually constitutes a Temporal application.**
  - **Implement an appropriate testing framework.**
- **How to develop applications for Durable Execution.**
  - **Identify SDK API calls that map to Events.**
  - **Recognize non-deterministic Workflow code.**
  - **Explain how Workflow code execution progresses.**

<!-- TODO
- **How to patch (version) Temporal Application code.**
- **How to gracefully handle application level errors from Activity Executions.**
- **How to cancel an in progress Workflow Execution.**
- **How to pass messages to and get data from from Workflow Executions.**
- **How to develop applications for throughput and distributed process states.**
-->

There is more to learn beyond these competencies. But, once you have become comfortable with these, then you should be able to build Temporal Applications for most use cases.

## Not covered

**What is not covered in this tutorial?**

This tutorial does not cover production level aspects of the application and its deployment.

- Data encryption: While a Background Check application is a good example of an application that handles personal identifiable information (PII) this tutorial does not cover that topic.
- Metrics: Emitting and monitoring metrics is typically an essential aspect of production level deployments. This tutorial does not cover that topic.
- Performance tuning: Improving the speed at which a Temporal Worker (your bundled application code) is capable of executing the next step in your application becomes essential for scaled out usage. This tutorial does not cover that topic.

## Feedback

**Where can I get help or provide feedback?**

There are multiple places you can go to engage with Temporal maintainers and the Temporal community to get help or provide feedback.
