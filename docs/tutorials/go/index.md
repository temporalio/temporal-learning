Go is an open source programming language that offers built-in concurrency and a robust standard library. It's popular for building microservices and command line tools.

Temporal's [Go SDK](https://docs.temporal.io/application-development/foundations/?lang=go/#add-your-sdk) lets you use Go to build applications that take advantage of Temporal's features.

These tutorials will walk you through building Temporal applications using Go.
