This four-part tutorial series will walk you through building a durable AI application that performs research and create reports using Temporal.

- **Tutorial 1**: Build your first chain workflow that performs research and outputs to a PDF while learning why durability matters for reliable applications

- **Tutorial 2**: Extend your chain workflow to be resilient against crashes, rate limits, and outages so your research app stays reliable

- **Tutorial 3**: Add durable human-in-the-loop capabilities to your reseearch application to review, refine, and query research results interactively

- **Tutorial 4**: Extent your chain workflow into an agentic loop that can plan, act, and adapt autonomously
