This two-part tutorial series will walk you through building understanding how to create durable AI applications with Temporal.

- **Tutorial 1**: Transform a simple LLM app (that does some research then generates PDFs) into a resilient system that handles crashes, rate limits, and outages using Temporal workflows.

- **Tutorial 2**: Add durable human-in-the-loop capabilities to your research application to review, refine, and query research results interactively
