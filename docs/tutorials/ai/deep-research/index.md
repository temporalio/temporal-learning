This three-part tutorial series will walk you through building a durable, multi-agent deep research application with human-in-the-loop capabilities using Temporal and the OpenAI Agents SDK.

- **Part 1: Setting the Stage**: Clone the template repository (a non-durable research agent), run it, and understand how the multi-agent pipeline works.

- **Part 2: Creating the Workflow**: Build the research manager to orchestrate agents and the workflow to manage state and human-in-the-loop interactions.

- **Part 3: Running Your Application**: Create the Temporal Worker with the OpenAI Agents plugin, and test durability by surviving crashes.
