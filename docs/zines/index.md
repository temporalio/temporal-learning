Check out [our first Zine](../../static/zines/zines.pdf), a comic that delves into the world of Temporal and Durable Execution. This Zine illustrates how Temporal works to ensure reliable and durable execution of tasks and covers the following from a high-level perspective:

- Why Durable Execution?
- What Can I Use Durable Execution For?
- What Happens If An External Service Goes Down?
- How Does Durable Execution Solve This Problem?
- How Does The Event History Guarantee Durable Execution?

Whether you're an engineer, someone without a technical background, or just curious about durable execution, our Zine offers an engaging way to learn about Temporal.

And, we have plans for future Zines as well!
