```go

// EmploymentVerification is a Workflow Definition that calls for the execution of a Side Effect, and an Activity,
// but then waits on and handles a Signal. It is also capable of handling a Query to get Candidate Details.
// This is executed as a Child Workflow by the main Background Check.
func EmploymentVerification(ctx workflow.Context, input *EmploymentVerificationWorkflowInput) (*EmploymentVerificationWorkflowResult, error) {
	var result EmploymentVerificationWorkflowResult

	err := workflow.SetQueryHandler(ctx, EmploymentVerificationDetailsQuery, func() (CandidateDetails, error) {
		return input.CandidateDetails, nil
	})
	if err != nil {
		return &result, err
	}

	researcher, err := chooseResearcher(ctx, input)
	if err != nil {
		return &result, err
	}

	err = emailEmploymentVerificationRequest(ctx, input, researcher)
