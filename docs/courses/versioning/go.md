## Description

In this course, you'll go beyond the fundamentals, learning how to safely evolve your Temporal application code in production. There are several approaches to versioning Temporal Workflows, and this course will cover each of them, bookended by examples of how to monitor and test your Workflow Execution History, so you can verify that your Versioning is working correctly.

When you've completed the course, you'll be able to:

- Apply an appropriate Versioning strategy to modify your Workflows
- Implement a Versioned Workflow
- Verify correct implementations of Versioning strategies

### Prerequisites:

To be successful in this course, you should have an understanding of the fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques used to develop and execute basic Temporal applications with the Go SDK. This includes the ability to develop and execute Temporal Workflows and Activities, navigate the Web UI, configure and run a Worker, as well as an understanding of the high-level interactions between the Temporal Application and Temporal Cluster during Workflow Execution. We strongly recommend that you complete Temporal 101 and 102, which cover these topics, before starting this course.

Since code used in examples and exercises are written in Go, you must also have at least basic proficiency with the Go programming language.
