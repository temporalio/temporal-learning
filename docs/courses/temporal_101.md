In this course, you will explore the basic building blocks of Temporal: Workflows and Activities. You’ll use these building blocks along with Temporal's Go SDK to develop a small application that communicates with an external service. You'll see how Temporal helps you recover from failures and explore Temporal's execution model and event history. You'll use the Temporal Web UI and Temporal’s command-line tools to explore and interact with your Workflows, and you'll use what you've learned to add new features to your existing workflow.

When you've completed the course, you'll be able to:

- Configure an environment for developing Temporal Applications
- Use Temporal to describe and implement a business process
- Interpret Temporal's workflow execution model
- Use Temporal’s tooling to manage the lifecycle of your application

Prerequisites:

To be successful in this course, you should have experience writing back-end applications that rely on external APIs.

This course uses the Go programming language. Previous Go experience is helpful, but not required.
