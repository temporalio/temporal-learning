**Estimated time**: ~⏱️ 3 hours, self-paced.

**Cost**: Free

## Description

In this course, you’ll expand your ability to write dynamic Workflows by interacting with them and enabling them to respond to external stimuli. You’ll use Signals to interact with your running Workflows, and use Queries to retrieve information about your Workflow Executions. You’ll filter for specific Workflow Executions based on Search Attributes that you tag your Workflow Executions with. You’ll use Cancellation Scopes to cancel specific parts of your Workflow. You’ll handle long-running or externally dependent tasks by asynchronously completing your Activities.

When you've completed the course, you'll be able to:

* Integrate Signals and Queries with Workflows
* Develop Custom Search Attributes to identify specific Workflow Executions
* Evaluate methods to stop Workflow Executions
* Develop Activities asynchronously

### Prerequisites:

To be successful in this course, you should have an understanding of the fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques used to develop and execute basic Temporal applications with the TypeScript SDK. This includes the ability to develop and execute Temporal Workflows and Activities, navigate the Web UI, configure and run a Worker, as well as an understanding of the high-level interactions between the Temporal Application and Temporal Cluster during Workflow Execution. We strongly recommend that you complete Temporal 101 and 102, which cover these topics, before starting this course.

Since code used in examples and exercises are written in TypeScript, you must also have at least basic proficiency with the TypeScript programming language.
