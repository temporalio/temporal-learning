## Description

In this course, you’ll expand your ability to write dynamic Workflows by interacting with them and enabling them to respond to external stimuli. You’ll use Signals to interact with your running Workflows, and use Queries to retrieve information about your Workflow Executions. You’ll filter for specific Workflow Executions based on Search Attributes that you tag your Workflow Executions with. You’ll use Cancellation Scopes to cancel specific parts of your Workflow. You’ll handle long-running or externally dependent tasks by asynchronously completing your Activities.

When you've completed the course, you'll be able to:

* Integrate Signals and Queries with Workflows
* Develop Custom Search Attributes to identify specific Workflow Executions
* Evaluate methods to stop Workflow Executions
* Develop Activities asynchronously
