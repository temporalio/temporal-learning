Go deeper with self-paced online courses that provide in-depth hands-on learning experiences.

## [Temporal 101: Introducing the Temporal Platform](temporal_101/index.md)

In this course, you will explore the basic building blocks of Temporal: Workflows and Activities. You’ll use these building blocks along with Temporal's SDKs to develop a small application that communicates with an external service. You'll see how Temporal helps you recover from failures and explore Temporal's execution model and event history. You'll use the Temporal Web UI and Temporal’s command-line tools to explore and interact with your Workflows, and you'll use what you've learned to add new features to your existing Workflow.

**Estimated time**: ~⏱️ 2 hours, self-paced.

**Cost**: Free

## [Securing Application Data](appdatasec/index.md)

In this course, you'll implement Custom Data Conversion for your Temporal Workflows.
By implementing Custom Data Converters and a Codec Server, you can expand this behavior to support a variety of complex input and output data. Incorporating encryption mechanisms into your Temporal Workflows adds several considerations around user management, encryption standards, and key rotation. This course provides some general guidance and example applications for addressing each of these considerations.

**Estimated time**: ⏱️ 2 hours, self-paced.
