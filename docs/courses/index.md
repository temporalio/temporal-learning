Go deeper with self-paced online courses that provide in-depth hands-on learning experiences.

## [Temporal 101: Introducing the Temporal Platform](temporal_101/index.md)

In this course, you will explore the basic building blocks of Temporal: Workflows and Activities. You’ll use these building blocks along with Temporal's SDKs to develop a small application that communicates with an external service. You'll see how Temporal helps you recover from failures and explore Temporal's execution model and event history. You'll use the Temporal Web UI and Temporal’s command-line tools to explore and interact with your Workflows, and you'll use what you've learned to add new features to your existing Workflow.

**Estimated time**: ~⏱️ 2 hours, self-paced.

**Cost**: Free

## [Temporal 102: Exploring Durable Execution](temporal_102/index.md)

In this course, you will go beyond the basics of Temporal application development. You will acquire skills necessary to use Temporal throughout the development lifecycle by learning how to test, debug, and deploy applications. You'll encounter several common problems faced by Temporal developers, understand why they occur, and how to identify, solve, and avoid them. Through heavy emphasis on key concepts and best practices, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how Temporal works and how to use it effectively.

**Estimated time**: ~⏱️ 4 hours, self-paced.

**Cost**: Free

## [Crafting an Error Handling Strategy](errstrat/index.md)

In this course, you will design and implement effective error handling strategies that map your business logic to the Temporal platform. You will explore the nature of different types of failures and investigate the support that Temporal provides for addressing them. Along the way, you will learn essential concepts and techniques, such as idempotence, Heartbeating, and the Saga Pattern, which will help you to ensure the correctness and responsiveness of your application.

**Estimated time**: ~⏱️ 2.5 hours, self-paced.

**Cost**: Free

## [Versioning Workflows](versioning/index.md)

In this course, you'll go beyond the fundamentals, learning how to safely evolve your Temporal application code in production. There are three primary approaches to versioning Temporal Workflows, and this course will cover each of them, bookended by examples of how to monitor and test your Workflow Execution History, so you can verify that your Versioning is working correctly.

**Estimated time**: ⏱️ 1.5 hours, self-paced.

**Cost**: Free

## [Securing Application Data](appdatasec/index.md)

In this course, you'll implement Custom Data Conversion for your Temporal Workflows.
By implementing Custom Data Converters and a Codec Server, you can expand this behavior to support a variety of complex input and output data. Incorporating encryption mechanisms into your Temporal Workflows adds several considerations around user management, encryption standards, and key rotation. This course provides some general guidance and example applications for addressing each of these considerations.

**Estimated time**: ⏱️ 2 hours, self-paced.
