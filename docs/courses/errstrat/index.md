## Description

In this course, you will design and implement effective error handling strategies that map your business logic to the Temporal platform. You will explore the nature of different types of failures and investigate the support that Temporal provides for addressing them. Along the way, you will learn essential concepts and techniques, such as idempotence, Heartbeating, and the Saga Pattern, which will help you to ensure the correctness and responsiveness of your application.

When you've completed the course, you'll be able to:
- Recommend an error handling strategy
- Implement an error handling strategy
- Integrate appropriate mechanisms for handling various types of errors
