## Description

In this course, you will design and implement effective error handling strategies that map your business logic to the Temporal platform. You will explore the nature of different types of failures and investigate the support that Temporal provides for addressing them. Along the way, you will learn essential concepts and techniques, such as idempotence, Heartbeating, and the Saga Pattern, which will help you to ensure the correctness and responsiveness of your application.

When you've completed the course, you'll be able to:
- Recommend an error handling strategy
- Implement an error handling strategy
- Integrate appropriate mechanisms for handling various types of errors

### Prerequisites:

To be successful in this course, you should have an understanding of the fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques used to develop and execute basic Temporal applications with the Go SDK. This includes the ability to develop and execute Temporal Workflows and Activities, navigate the Web UI, configure and run a Worker, as well as an understanding of the high-level interactions between the Temporal Application and Temporal Cluster during Workflow Execution. We strongly recommend that you complete Introducing the Temporal Platform (Temporal 101) and Exploring Durable Execution (Temporal 102), which cover these topics, before starting this course.

Since code used in examples and exercises are written in Go, you must also have at least basic proficiency with the Go programming language.
