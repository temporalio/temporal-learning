![Temporal Go SDK](/img/sdk_banners/banner_go.png)

In this course, you will go beyond the basics of Temporal application development. You will acquire skills necessary to use Temporal throughout the full development lifecycle by learning how to test, debug, deploy, and update applications. You'll encounter several common problems faced by Temporal developers, understand why they occur, and how to identify, solve, and avoid them. Through heavy emphasis on key concepts and best practices, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how Temporal works and how to use it effectively. 

When you've completed the course, you'll be able to:
- Apply Temporal best practices for application development
- Validate application behavior through automated testing
- Evaluate an Event History to debug problems with Workflow Execution
- Safely incorporate changes to Temporal Applications running in production

Prerequisites:

To be successful in this course, you should have an understanding of the fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques used to develop and execute basic Temporal Applications with the Go SDK. This includes the ability to develop and execute Temporal Workflows and Activities, navigate the Web UI, configure and run a Worker, as well as an understanding of the high-level interactions between the Temporal Application and Temporal Cluster during Workflow Execution. We strongly recommend that you complete Temporal 101, which covers these topics, before starting this course.

Since code used in examples and exercises are written in Go, you must also have at least basic proficiency with the Go programming language.
