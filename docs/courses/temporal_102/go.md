:::

In this course, you will go beyond the basics of Temporal application development. You will acquire skills necessary to use Temporal throughout the full development lifecycle by learning how to test, debug, deploy, and update applications. You'll encounter several common problems faced by Temporal developers, understand why they occur, and how to identify, solve, and avoid them. Through heavy emphasis on key concepts and best practices, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how Temporal works and how to use it effectively.

When you've finished the course, you'll be able to

- Apply Temporal best practices for application development
- Validate application behavior through automated testing
- Evaluate an Event History to debug problems with Workflow Execution
- Safely incorporate changes to Temporal Applications running in production

Prerequisites:

This course is intended for experienced software developers who have at least basic proficiency with the Go programming language and an understanding of the fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques used to develop and execute basic Temporal applications in Go. This includes the ability to develop and execute Temporal Workflows and Activities, navigate the Web UI, configure and run a Worker, as well as an understanding of the high-level interactions between the Temporal Application and Temporal Cluster during Workflow Execution.

Since our Temporal 101 provides the foundational knowledge upon which this course builds, we strongly recommend successfully completing that course before beginning Temporal 102. However, those who have gained this knowledge through practical experience may elect to skip Temporal 101 and begin with Temporal 102.

This course is coming soon.
