## Description

In this course, you'll go beyond those basics, acquiring skills that will help you on your journey to production deployment. Along the way, you'll encounter several common problems faced by Temporal developers, find out why they occur, and more importantly, how to identify and solve them, as well as how to avoid them in the future. By emphasizing key concepts and best practices, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how Temporal works and how to use it effectively.

When you've completed the course, you'll be able to:

- Apply Temporal best practices for application development
- Validate application behavior through automated testing
- Evaluate an Event History to debug problems with Workflow Execution

### Prerequisites:

To be successful in this course, you should have an understanding of the fundamental concepts, tools, and techniques used to develop and execute basic Temporal applications with the Java SDK. This includes the ability to develop and execute Temporal Workflows and Activities, navigate the Web UI, configure and run a Worker, as well as an understanding of the high-level interactions between the Temporal Application and Temporal Cluster during Workflow Execution. We strongly recommend that you complete Temporal 101, which covers these topics, before starting this course.

Since code used in examples and exercises are written in Java, you must also have at least basic proficiency with the Java programming language.
