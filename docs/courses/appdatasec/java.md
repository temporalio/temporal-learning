## Description

In this course, you'll learn how to implement Custom Data Conversion for your Temporal Workflows. Temporal's SDKs enable you to define Workflows and Activities in your preferred programming language. During execution, the Temporal Client converts your input parameters and return values into a language-neutral format before they're transmitted and stored in the Event History. You might not be aware of this conversion this because Temporal provides a default Data Converter that handles it for you automatically.

By implementing Custom Data Converters and a Codec Server, you can expand this behavior to support a variety of complex input and output data. Incorporating encryption mechanisms into your Temporal Workflows adds several additional considerations around user management, encryption standards, and key rotation. This course provides some general guidance and example applications for addressing each of these considerations.
