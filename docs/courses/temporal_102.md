:::

In this course you'll go beyond basic workflow execution. You'll use Temporal to build a small application that manages user subscriptions. You'll create long-running Workflows that execute activities repeatedly, and you'll use Signals and Queries to interact with your running Workflows. Then youâ€™ll write tests for your Workflows to ensure you can maintain them going forward.

After completing this course, you'll be able to:

- Implement Workflows with multiple steps and outcomes.
- Use Signals to alter workflow execution
- Use queries to retrieve values from workflows.
* Develop Tests for Temporal workflows

Prerequisites:

To be successful in this course, you should have completed the Temporal 101 course or be able to create Temporal Workflows, Activities, and Workers that run basic workflow executions, and have a solid understanding of Temporal's Workflow Execution model.

This course is coming soon.
