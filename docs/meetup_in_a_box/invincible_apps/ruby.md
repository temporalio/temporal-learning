## Description

This presentation introduces Ruby developers of all experience levels to Durable Execution and Temporal.
In this presentation, you will lead the audience through the fundamental building blocks of Temporal, including the Temporal Service, Workflows, Activities, Workers, Durable Timers, and Task Queues.
You will explore a distributed Hello World example that uses external services to obtain your IP address and then uses the result as input to a geo-location service, returning a greeting that provides your IP address and where you currently are.
Along the way, you'll demonstrate various failure scenarios, and how Temporal handles them by providing Durable Execution.

Thank you for your interest in Temporal, we hope you enjoy this Meetup in a Box!
